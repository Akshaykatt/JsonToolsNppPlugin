and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
 
## [Unreleased] - yyyy-mm-dd
 
### To Be Added

This project has many features that were implemented in a [standalone app](https://github.com/molsonkiko/JSON-Tools) requiring .NET 6.0. Those features will be rolled out in the plugin over the next couple of months.

1. A tool for searching directories for many documents and using RemesPath to query them all in parallel. The query results can then be written to separate files.
    * This tool will also probably have a feature for sending API requests and getting the JSON directly for querying. No more writing scripts!
	* Ideally the API request tool should let people enter the URL and the name of the file to be created for that JSON in a CSV file.
 
### To Be Changed

- I am trying to implement lazy loading of subtrees, so that subtrees of the tree view aren't populated until the user clicks on the `+` button. If properly implemented, this would be a marked improvement over the partial tree loading or no-tree option implemented in [version 3.1.0](https://github.com/molsonkiko/JsonToolsNppPlugin/releases/tag/v3.1.0).
- *If lazy loading can't be implemented:*
	- Allow full tree display of small query results even if full tree display is disallowed for the entire JSON.
- Make it so that RemesPath assignment queries like `@.foo = @ + 1` only change the parts of the tree viewer that were affected by the assignment. Would greatly reduce latency because that's the slowest operation.
- Improve how well the caret tracks the node selected in the query tree.
- Maybe make it so that creating the tree automatically pretty-prints the JSON?
- Add parsing of unquoted strings when linter is active.
	(would this cause too much of a performance hit?)
- Add RemesPath functions:
	- for converting JSON to tabular form
	- for dates and datetimes (e.g., a `datediff` function that creates
	somthing like a Python TimeDelta that you can add to DateTimes and Dates)
 
### To Be Fixed

- The `ClassifySchema` function (used by the `Default` strategy for JSON tabularization) has problems when parsing some queries, even though those queries are clearly tabularizable. Something about keys missing from a dictionary. Most likely related to bad schemas. 
- JsonSchema has some bugs in the ordering of types. Non-impactful, I think. For example, a type list might come out as `["string", "integer"]` rather than `["integer", "string"]`.
- Remove bug in determination of `required` keys for JsonSchema. As far as I know, this only occurs in very specific cases for the bottom object in an `array->object->array->object->object` hierarchy.
- Fix bugs in YamlDumper.cs:
	- fails when key contains quotes and colon
	- fails when value contains quotes and newline
	- fails when value contains quotes and colon
	- fails when key contains singlequotes and doublequotes
- Fix bug with the range() function where if the first or second argument is a uminus'd function of the CurJson there's an error because the uminus somehow maybe turned the int into a float(???). Error is raised on line 1706 of RemesPath.cs. E.g., `range(-len(@))` and `range(0, -len(@))`) will throw errors.
- Sometimes recursive queries may cause an infinite loop, or something else that leads to Notepad++ crashing. Recursive queries are almost always fine, and I only saw this bug once. Not sure why yet.

## [3.2.0] - 2022-09-19

### Added

1. [Checkbox in tree view for toggling full-tree view of the JSON](/docs/README.md#changing-how-much-json-tree-is-displayed).
2. [JSON Lines documents can now be parsed](/docs/README.md#json-lines-documents).

### Changed

1. Got rid of keyboard shortcut for `Run Tests`, since that's really only for people who are debugging the plugin.

## [3.1.0] - 2022-09-17

### Added

1. New setting (`use_tree`) for disabling the tree altogether. Since populating the tree is generally slower than parsing JSON or executing queries, this can provide a significant responsiveness boost.
2. New setting (`max_size_full_tree_MB`) for the maximum size, in megabytes, of a JSON file (default 4) such that the entire JSON tree will be recursively added to the tree view. Populating the full tree could lead to massive latency and memory consumption. Any file above this size will only have the __direct children__ of the root added to the tree, to provide some minimal quality of life without greatly compromising performance.
	- This setting also applies to queries, although I will attempt to add some code to determine if the query resultset is small enough that populating the query's full tree would not be too expensive.

### Bugfixes

1. Fully eliminated early cutoff of CSV files produced by the JSON->CSV form containing non-ascii characters by using `Encoding.UTF8.GetByteCount` instead of my own bespoke byte-counting algorithm.
2. For both the ToString method of string JNodes and the JsonParser, implemented the algorithm used by Python's JSON encoder and decoder for handling surrogate pairs of Unicode characters that represent characters greater than 0xffff.

### Changed

1. As noted above, the default behavior is now to only display the top-level nodes of the JSON for 4+ MB files in the tree view. This can be changed in settings.

## [3.0.0] - 2022-08-30

### Added

1. New 0-arg constructor for JNode that makes a JNode with null value, Dtype.NULL, line_num 0.
2. New 0-arg constructors for JArray and JObject that create instances with no children.

### Bugfixes

1. Fixed some bugs in JsonSchema, but it's still kind of a mess.

### Changed

1. The Make Schema button has been removed, and will not be reintroduced until JsonSchema.cs is debugged. There are enough *known* bugs with JsonSchema.cs on top of the *unknown* bugs that users should not be shown the feature at all, lest they believe it is robust enough to consistently give them a valid schema.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-08-28

### Added

1. Assignment operator in RemesPath. Now you can __edit__ documents with RemesPath, not just query them!
2. Menu option for converting a JSON document to YAML. Until I fix the bugs, it will throw up a message box warning the user that this option has some known bugs.

### Bugfixes

- So it turns out that `Convert.ToDouble(null)`, `Convert.ToInt64(null)`, and `Convert.ToBoolean(null)` all return `0`, which meant that before I added a bunch more runtime type checking, there were stupid bugs with vectorized arithmetic where you could get something like querying `@ - 1` with input `[[]]` returning `[-1.0]`. That has been fixed, and tests have been added to make sure it works.

### Changed
- `RemesParser.Search` and `RemesPathLexer.Compile` now have a required `out bool` parameter that indicates whether the query was an assignment expression. This is a __backwards-incompatible change__.
	- I may try to come up with a better solution, but it seems important for the parser to give some indication of whether the input JSON was mutated.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-08-27

### Added

- RemesPath querying to the tree viewer
- Conversion of RemesPath query results to CSV files
- Creation of JSON schemas for query results

### Changed

- Because RemesPath querying has been added, the tree now tracks the query result rather than the underlying JSON. The caret tracking still mostly works, but only if the query is identity (`@`) or purely indexing-based (i.e., selecting indices from arrays, keys from objects, and applying boolean indices).

## [1.1.1] - 2022-08-27

### Bugfixes

- JsonParser will no longer accept invalid JSON that has anything other than whitespace at the end of a valid document.
	- For example `[1, 2, 3] d` would previously have been accepted (ignoring the `d` at the end) and now the parser will reject it.

### Changed

- Longs (type used for integers in our JSON) are always converted to doubles before comparison to other numbers.
	- Previously, if x was an long and y was a double, the comparison `x > y` would involve converting y to a long, but an identical comparison with different operand order `y < x` would involve converting x to a double.
	- For example, `3.5 < 4` would previously (and still will) return `true` because 4 would be converted to 4.0, but `4 > 3.5` would previously have returned `false` because 3.5 would be converted to 4.
	- The only downside of this approach is that integers between 4.5036e15 (2 ^ 52) and 9.2234e18 (2 ^ 63)
		can be precisely represented by longs but not by doubles, so those integers will have a loss of precision.
- Parsing multiple files found by grepping or multiple API request responses is now multithreaded.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-08-26

### Added

- JSON tree viewer

### Bugfixes

- All known bugs with RemesPath, except the weird issue with uminus'd functions of CurJson as the second argument to the `range(x,y,z)` function.
- Got rid of issue where RemesPath query compilation time was incorrectly calculated.


## [1.0.0] - 2022-08-26

### Added

- Contains only the minimum functionality required to be useful. Linting syntax errors, changing parser settings to allow comments and whatnot, etc.

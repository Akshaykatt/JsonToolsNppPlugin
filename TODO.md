TODO

0. Add UI unit tests for:
    * grepper form
    * find/replace form
    * error form
1. Make sure there are no plugin crashes when using selections (I don't know what makes them happen, but they seem to be harmless).
2. Make sure sort form, find/replace form all correctly reformat documents with multiple selections
3. Add form for managing selections
4. Fix bug with select all JSONs when one touches EOF in 7.3.3
5. Add ability to merge selections
6. WHY IN GOD'S NAME DO THE UI TESTS SOMETIMES RANDOMLY CRASH AND CAUSE NOTEPAD++ TO HANG?
